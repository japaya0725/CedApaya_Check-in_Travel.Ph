                <h4 class="media-heading">Printing your boarding pass online</h4>
                You have to log into your travel account anywhere between 12 and 24 hours before your flight is ready for departure. Different
                airlines have different rules, but generally, you should be able to check into the airline at least a day before or on the day you
                are supposed to travel. Today, most of the airlines will send you an email in good time, with information on when you will be able to check in.</p>
                <p>Enter your frequent flyer number or reference number and log in. Most of the information you need to log in should be available with
                  the email you receive from your airline.</p>
                <p>Double check and make sure that the flight times and your seat are correct. Once you are logged in, you can see and confirm the itinerary.
                   Before you proceed to checking in, ensure that all the information you have is accurate.</p>
               <p>Proceed to check in. You can also print your boarding pass. There will be instructions on-screen that are very easy to understand and follow.</p>
              <p>Print the boarding pass. Make sure you have enough ink on your printer and have the printing done to scale. Do not stretch or shrink the document.</p>
              <p>You can now show your boarding pass at different security checkpoints at the airport. In case you have baggage that has to be checked in, 
                you will have to approach the support desk and they will also need to see your boarding pass before they can assist you.</p>

                <h4 class="media-heading">Checking in online</h4>
                <p>Today a lot of airlines allow customers to check in online or through their mobile phones at least 24 hours before the flight departs. 
                  There are a number of reasons why you should strongly try this out, given that you can have your boarding pass ready at the same time. 
                  How does this help you in the long run? Why is it necessary that you check in online instead of waiting to do that at the airport? </p>

                <h4 class="media-heading">Security access</h4>
                <p>No one wants to waste time at the different security checkpoints at the airport. By checking in early, you get to the security checkpoints faster. 
                  In fact, if you do not have any bags to check in, you will proceed straight to the final security checkpoints when you get to the airport. 
                  Take note that security checkpoints may or may not have a long line when you get there, so even if you check in online, you should still make sure 
                  you get to the airport in good time and allow yourself sufficient time to proceed with the security procedures before you are allowed into the waiting 
                  area.</p>

                <h4 class="media-heading">Seat selection</h4>
                <p>You know how long your flight is, and for someone who has traveled so many times, you know which seats are comfortable or have better leg room.
                   When you are checking in online, you are usually able to select the seats you want for your trip. To enjoy this when going through the traditional 
                   check-in process at the airport, you would have to arrive earlier and hope that the seats you want have not been taken already</p>

                <h4 class="media-heading">Skip Section</h4>
                <p>Traditionally, for you to check in at the airport, you will find a long line of passengers who were there before you, all waiting to be assisted
                  for one reason or the other. During the peak seasons, the lines can be so long, and you would have to be at the airport earlier, not mentioning 
                  the time you would be wasting standing in line.
                  <br>Assuming that you are traveling with kids, you can imagine how stressful and boring this can be for them. When you check in online before you come
                  to the airport, you will even print your boarding pass, so you no longer have to stand in these queues. You can even check in all the bags you are
                  traveling with, and pay for them. In case the option is available, you can use the curbside baggage drop-off point for your airline or their
                  baggage kiosks.</p>
